Title: Rebase from Terminal

# Rebase from Github via Terminal

When you need to rebase from Github via terminal because you're having conflict issues, here's what you'll want to do.

## CD into the directory

If you are above the directory, you'll want to CD into the correct directory.

```bash
cd guide
```

## Run `git pull github main`

```bash
git pull github main
```

## If that doesn't work, run `git config pull.rebase true`

That will rebase the repo. Then try `git pull github main` again.

Here's what you end up getting from the terminal:

```bash
marktenney@Marks-iMac guide % git pull github main
From https://github.com/digitalchurch/guide
 * branch            main       -> FETCH_HEAD
hint: You have divergent branches and need to specify how to reconcile them.
hint: You can do so by running one of the following commands sometime before
hint: your next pull:
hint: 
hint:   git config pull.rebase false  # merge
hint:   git config pull.rebase true   # rebase
hint:   git config pull.ff only       # fast-forward only
hint: 
hint: You can replace "git config" with "git config --global" to set a default
hint: preference for all repositories. You can also pass --rebase, --no-rebase,
hint: or --ff-only on the command line to override the configured default per
hint: invocation.
fatal: Need to specify how to reconcile divergent branches.

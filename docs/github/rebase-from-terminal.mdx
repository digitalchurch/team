# Rebase from Github via Terminal

When you need to rebase from Github via terminal because you're having conflict issues, here's what you'll want to do.

## Pull the repo from GitHub

```bash
git pull github main
```

## If that doesn't work, rebase the repo from GitHub

```bash
git config pull.rebase true
```

That will rebase the repo. Then try `git pull github main` again.

Once you've pulled the changes back from Github, you'll be able to sync your latest local changes.

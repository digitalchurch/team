## Set up Google Chrome

An easy way to generate screenshots using the Google Chrome device emulator. You will need to add 2 new device sizes to the emulator to get the necessary sizes.

#### 1. Open the developer tools: *View > Developer > Developer Tools* `CMD+OPT+i`

#### 2. If you are not already in responsive device mode, you may need to click the device icon at the top left of the developer tools window.

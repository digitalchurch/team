## Blank Pages on in-app Links

Sometimes we will run into issues with blank pages popping up in the in-app browser when we are trying to set up .push-page links in the app. The issue is using relative links (i.e. /events) rather than absolute links (like https://yourdigial.church/events). Here's a video showing this solution in detail:

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/935464947?badge=0&amp;autopause=0&amp;player_id=0&amp;app_id=58479"
    width="100%"
    height="100%"
    controls={true}
    playing={true}
    muted={true}
     />
</div>

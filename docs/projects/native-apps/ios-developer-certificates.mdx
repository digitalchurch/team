   > You will generate the following files:

   1. **Certificate Signing Request** (only *one is needed* per development mac) in *Keychain Access* on your Mac. This must be from the mac you are working on in order to be able to generate the remaining certificates.
   2. **Distribution Certificate** from your [developer account](https://developer.apple.com/account).
   3. **.p12 File** (bundles private key with certificate) from Keychain Access.
   4. **Wildcard Provisioning Profile** from your developer account.

      6. Open the `ios_development.cer` in Keychain Access and import it into your *System* keychain (not into your icloud keychain).
      7. Search for "Distribution" in Keychain Access and find your newly added certificate. (Hint: it will be the one that expires in 365 days). Select both the **Distribition Certificate** AND the **private key** with the common name you used when you generated the CSR file above. Right-click and **Export** those files as a .p12 file.

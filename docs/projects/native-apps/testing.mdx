# Testing

## Internal Testing

   Once the app store listing and bitrise have both been setup, you can run an **iOS Debug** build in the AppPresser customizer, and that will push a test release you can test on an internal device.

   **Make sure your device is added as a bitrise test device as well!**

[Bitrise - Mobile Continuous Integration and Delivery - iOS & Android Build Automation](https://app.bitrise.io/me/profile#/test_devices)

   1. Make sure the device has developmer mode enabled in **Settings > Privacy & Security > Developer Mode**

## TestFlight

   Once the app store listing and bitrise have both been setup, you can run an **iOS Debug** build in the AppPresser customizer, and that will push a test release you can test on an internal device.

   Once you've submitted the first build, you'll need to view the build in appstoreconnect.apple.com and complete the compliance information. (select "None of the Algorithms Mentioned Above")

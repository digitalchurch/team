## Prepare for Certificate Generation

1. Open the downloaded repo in VSCode.
2. Check to make sure fastlane is installed by running `fastlane -v`
3. Open the fastfile and edit lines 11-25 with the correct information. See the example below:

```js {3-7,15-17} showLineNumbers
#Fill These based on your app data

site_slug = "digital-church"    ##This is the slug at the end of your MyAppPresser URL. IE: myapppresser.com/mysiteslug
app_name = "Mason Street COC"  ##This is the Name of your app as set under the Settings -> App Name field
app_id = "app.digitalchurch.masonstreetchurchofchrist"  ##This is your app ID as set under the Settings -> App ID field. NOTE: If you have an existing app this MUST match the bundle ID of the existing app
username = "mark.tenney@icloud.com" ##Your Apple account Username
iospassword = ".CK_uteMhT4TZzo!sGZL"  ##The Password for your iOS Certificates (dev, prod & prodpush). This will be required in Bitrise to unlock the certs as well as MyAppPresser in the push notification settings.

##LEAVE BLANK unless you're using a shared account with access to multiple teams
#To get Team ID, run fastlane appp and take the correct team ID from the first prompt then kill the script
team_id = ""

##Create an android keystore by running "fastlane android". Alias will be the same as the filename
#Android Keystore Variables ## Use fastlane android to generate these
custname = "Digital Church"  ##Replace with your name
countrycode = "US"  ##Your 2 letter Country Code.
keystorepassword = ".CK_uteMhT4TZzo!sGZL"  ##Replace this with your own password for the Keystore. MAKE SURE YOU SAVE THIS PW. You'll need to enter it into Bitrise later

#Change to false if re-running the tool with a pre-existing push cert to avoid creating duplicates
forcepush = "false"

## No More edits required below ##

# Introduction

Quick builds are template based website builds that are designed to be deployed quickly and easily. Here is an overview of the process.

1. Client submits a request for a quick build.
2. We clone the template site and deploy it to the client's subdomain.
3. Setup a new project in Asana.
4. Install Feedbucket and connect it to the Asana project.
5. We create a new client portal for the client in Craft.
6. Record a video showing the client how to use the portal.
7. Email the client with their portal details and video.
8. Once the client has completed the portal information, we edit the site to reflect the client's information.
9. Record a video showing the changes we made to the site and how to leave comments on the site.
10. Finish the build by completing the client's requests in Feedbucket.
11. Once the client has approved the build, we deploy the site to the client's custom domain.

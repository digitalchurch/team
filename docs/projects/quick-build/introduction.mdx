# Introduction

Quick builds are template based website builds that are designed to be deployed quickly and easily. Here is an overview of the process. This process starts with the client submitting a request for a quick build at [digitalchurch.com/start](https://www.digitalchurch.com/start/).

1. We **clone the template site** and deploy it to the client's subdomain.
2. Setup a **new project** in Asana, Feedbucket, & Dropbox.
3. We create a **new client portal** for the client in Craft.
4. **Email the client** with their portal details and video walkthrough.
5. Once the client has completed the portal information, we **edit the site** to reflect the client's information.
6. **Email the client** with instructions on how to leave comments on the site.
7. **Finish the build** by completing the client's requests in Feedbucket.
8. Once the client has approved the build, we **deploy the site** to the client's custom domain.

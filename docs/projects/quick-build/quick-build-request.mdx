# Quick Build Request

Clients request a quick build when they sign up for a new website at [digitalchurch.com/start](https://www.digitalchurch.com/start/).

We receive an email that includes the following information:

- Workspace Name
- Custom Domain
- Template Name
- Client Name
- Client Email

This gives us enough information to set up the initial website. We'll follow up by sending the a client portal with more information needed.

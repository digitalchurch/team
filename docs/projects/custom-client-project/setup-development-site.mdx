# Setup a New Development Website for a Client Project

import ReactPlayer from 'react-player';

<div className='player-wrapper'>
<ReactPlayer url="https://player.vimeo.com/video/744702958"

When we take on a custom website for our clients, we usually need to do the site setup process for them. Here’s how to do that:

## Visit the Network Admin Area

Visit the network admin area here: https://digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/network/

## View Network Apps (websites)

Go to the Apps (sites) listing here: https://digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/network/admin.php?page=wp-ultimo-sites

## Add a New App

1. Click on the Add App button.

2. Fill out the form with the App Title, App Domain/Path, App Type of Customer-Owned, and Select the Copy App option, choosing the correct template.

3. Press the Add new App button.

The page will refresh with a settings page for that particular app. You can now move on to setting up individual site settings, pages, etc.

# Native Apps with Expo

White-label native apps for churches, powered by Expo and managed from their WordPress dashboard.

## How It Works

The church's WordPress site becomes the app dashboard. Church admins manage their app alongside everything else in Digital Church — no separate portal needed.

### Architecture

Two repos are involved:

| Repo | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **`digitalchurch-app`** (Expo) | The native app codebase. Builds iOS and Android apps. |
| **`digitalchurch-wordpress`** | The dashboard controls. Churches configure and manage their app from the same place they manage their website. |

### What Lives Where

**Expo Repo (`digitalchurch-app`):**
- App shell and navigation
- Native features (push notifications, offline, etc.)
- Build and deployment pipeline via EAS
- App Store / Play Store submission automation

**WordPress Repo (App Dashboard):**
- Push notification composer and scheduling
- App branding (colors, logos, splash screen)
- Tab configuration (which tabs appear, ordering, content)
- Feature toggles
- App content management (pulls from the same data as the website)

## Key Differences from AppPresser

| Feature | AppPresser (Old) | Expo (New) |
|---------|------------------|------------|
| App configuration | MyAppPresser.com dashboard | WordPress admin |
| Build system | Bitrise | Expo EAS Build |
| Certificate management | Manual upload to Bitrise | Managed by EAS (or stored in EAS Secrets) |
| Content updates | API calls to WordPress | Same — REST API to WordPress |
| Custom views | HTML/CSS in AppPresser dashboard | React Native components |
| Build triggers | AppPresser dashboard | EAS CLI or GitHub Actions |

## Philosophy

The website is the hub. The app extends it into people's pockets. Churches shouldn't need a second admin panel to manage their app — the WordPress dashboard they already use handles it all.

## Key Features

- **Push notifications** — Compose and schedule from the WordPress dashboard
- **Branding controls** — Set app colors, icons, splash screen without touching code
- **Tab configuration** — Choose which tabs appear and what content they show
- **Shared content** — Sermons, events, groups, giving all flow from the same source as the website
- **White-label** — Each church gets their own branded app in the stores
- **OTA updates** — Push JavaScript updates without app store review via EAS Update

# Getting Started

This guide walks through setting up a new native app for a church using our Expo-based system.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have:

1. **Apple Developer Account** — Enrolled in the [Apple Developer Program](https://developer.apple.com/programs/) ($99/year)
2. **Google Play Developer Account** — Registered on [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console) ($25 one-time)
3. **EAS CLI installed** — `npm install -g eas-cli`
4. **Access to the digitalchurch-app repo**

## Step 1: WordPress Configuration

The church's WordPress site controls the app configuration. Enable the native app features:

1. Go to **Digital Church → Native App** in wp-admin
2. Enable the Native App module
3. Configure basic settings:
   - **App Name** — The display name in app stores
   - **Bundle ID** — Reverse domain format (e.g., `app.digitalchurch.clientname`)
   - **Primary Color** — Used throughout the app UI
   - **Accent Color** — Secondary brand color

## Step 2: Upload App Assets

Upload the required assets in **Digital Church → Native App → Branding**:

| Asset | Specifications |
|-------|----------------|
| **App Icon** | 1024×1024 PNG, no transparency, no rounded corners (system adds them) |
| **Splash Screen** | 1284×2778 PNG (or SVG for auto-scaling) |
| **Adaptive Icon Foreground** | 1024×1024 PNG with safe zone for Android adaptive icons |

:::tip Asset Generation
Use a tool like [Icon Kitchen](https://icon.kitchen/) or [Figma's App Icon Template](https://www.figma.com/community/file/824894885635013369) to generate all required sizes from a single source file.
:::

## Step 3: Configure App Tabs

In **Digital Church → Native App → Navigation**, configure which tabs appear:

- **Home** — Landing screen with featured content
- **Sermons** — Sermon archive with audio/video playback
- **Events** — Upcoming events from the church calendar
- **Groups** — Small group directory and membership
- **Giving** — Link to online giving (opens in-app browser)
- **More** — Additional links and settings

Drag tabs to reorder. Toggle visibility for each tab.

## Step 4: Create App Configuration

Generate the app configuration for the Expo build:

```bash
# From the digitalchurch-app repo
eas build:configure
```

This creates an `eas.json` file if one doesn't exist. Each client app uses environment variables to pull their specific configuration from their WordPress site.

## Step 5: Build & Deploy

See [Building & Deployment](./building-deployment.mdx) for detailed build instructions.

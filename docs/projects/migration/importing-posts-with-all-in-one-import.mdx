# Importing Posts into a Staging Site

:::info PreRequisites
Follow the instructions in [Cloning to Staging](/migration/cloning-to-dev-staging) to setup a staging site first. Do NOT attempt to import posts with this plugin on the production network.
:::

Once you've imported the site into staging, you can use WP All Import Pro to import posts from other websites using RSS Feeds, CSV files, and more.

1. Visit Dashboard > Plugins on the subsite you want to import into and activate the WP All Import Pro plugin you will need.
2. Go to All Import > New Import and import the source.
3. Once you've imported the posts, export them using the standard WordPress XML Export tools and import them into the live production site.

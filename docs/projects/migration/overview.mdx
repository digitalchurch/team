# Overview

There are a few different types of content migrations that we perform. Content migrations have the goal of getting clients onboarded onto Digital Church quickly without any customizations. We give them a launch-ready website that has all their important existing website content on it. They have access to our templates if they would like to continue to develop their site post-launch, or we can potentially do some paid customizations for them as well.

## Content-Only

Content-Only Migrations assume that the client does not want their website to look the same as it did. We perform these migrations for free, as long as the client has paid an up-front annual subscription. The amount of time these projects should take is 4-6 hours.

## Cloning Migrations

Cloning migrations assume the client wants a close 1:1 copy of their website. Because our system almost definitely uses different software than what was used on the client site, we have to rebuild most of the content from scratch. Clients who want this must pay a setup fee, generally starting at $500. The amount of time we should spend on projects like this should be 6-8 hours in total. When possible, we'll attempt to migration library content like sermons or events using digitalchurch.dev as a staging area.

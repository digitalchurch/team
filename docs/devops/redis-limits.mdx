Title: Redis Limits

# Setting Limits for Redis

GridPane sets redis memory limits at 10% of the available RAM by default. For our platform, it is better to run the redis at 20%. GridPane suggests that we never exceed 25%.

## Calculating 20% of RAM

Check the server RAM using this command:

In the terminal, run the command `free -h` and you'll receive something like this:

```bash
root@digitalchurch-prod:~/www/digitalchurch.app# free -h
              total        used        free      shared  buff/cache   available
Mem:           15Gi       7.3Gi       4.0Gi       108Mi       4.4Gi       7.9Gi
Swap:         4.0Gi       122Mi       3.9Gi
```

In this instance, our server has a total RAM allocation of ~16GB. Multiply that by 20% and we need to allocate 3200 MB.

## Use GP-CLI to set Redis to 20%

Using the above example, our command would look like this:

```bash
gp stack redis -max-memory 3200
```

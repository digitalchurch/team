# Migrating from WordPress Multisite to WordPress Multitenancy

Migrating from Multisite (WPMU) to Multitenancy (WPMT) is a delicate process. This is a very specific process that must be followed exactly to make sure nothing goes wrong. Whenever possible, we will use wp-cli to keep things as efficient as possible.

## Build a New Staging Site on the Development Server

https://my.gridpane.com/sites

- Server: development
- System User: Autocreate new user
- WP Users: GridPane Default WP Admin Only
- Bundles: None
- PHP Version: 7.4
- PHP Process Management: Dynamic
- Server Caching: Redis Object & Page
- WAF: 7G
- SMTP Integration: Sendgrid
- SSL: AutoSSL
- DNS API Integration: Cloudflare
- Local Backups: Daily
- Remote Backups: Weekly
- Git Integration: digitalchurch-wordpress
- Git Branch: main


## Backup the Multisite Installation using All-in-One WP Migration

### 1. Put the source multisite site in Multisite Maintenance Mode

The wp-cli command below will activate the Multisite Maintenance Mode plugin. Be sure to replace the `{{site.url}}` with the domain of the site you are moving.

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app plugin activate multisite-maintenance-mode --url={{site.url}}
```

### 2. Disable the CDN Rewriting from Perfmatters

Visit: `https://site.url/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=perfmatters#cdn`

### 3. Use WP All-in-One Migration to backup site

Digital Church: https://digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/network/admin.php?page=ai1wm_export   
Blackline Branding: https://blackline.limited/wp-admin/network/admin.php?page=ai1wm_export

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app ai1wm backup --exclude-inactive-themes --exclude-muplugins --exclude-plugins --exclude-inactive-plugins --exclude-cache --sites={{site.url}}
```

- **✅ Do not export themes (files)**
- **✅ Do not export inactive themes (files)**

## Migrate from Multisite to Single Staging

### 1. Create a Backup Directory

```bash
mkdir ~/www/{{site.url}}/htdocs/wp-content/ai1wm-backups/;
chmod 0777 ~/www/{{site.url}}/htdocs/wp-content/ai1wm-backups/;
chmod 0777 ~/www/{{site.url}}/htdocs/wp-content/plugins/all-in-one-wp-migration/storage/
```

### 2. Activate All-In-One WP Migration

```bash
gp wp {{site.url}} plugin activate all-in-one-wp-migration
gp wp {{site.url}} plugin activate all-in-one-wp-migration-multisite-extension
```

### 3. Move the backup to the new single site install

- Move the backup file to the new single site install via FTP.
- Copy the uploads folder from the WPMU `/uploads/sites/{id}/` to the `/uploads/` directory of the new single install.

### 4. Restore the backup into the single Installation

Restore the backup. Start by listing the backups.

```bash
gp wp {{site.url}} ai1wm list-backups
```

Then copy the backup name and restore it with this command.

```bash
gp wp {{site.url}} ai1wm restore {{backup-name}}
```

## Clone from Single Installation to WPMT

### 1. In GridPane, access the single installation site editor.

### 2. in the clone tab, clone the site to the WPMT server.

### 3. Check active plugins on new server

Run this command on the source multisite to see what plugins are active on that site.

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app plugin list --status=active,active-network --format=csv --fields=name --url={{site.url}}
```

Then run this command on the multitenant install to see if the activate the same plugins.
```bash
gp wp {{site.url}} plugin activate {{paste-list-here}}
```

Tip: You can use AI to build the new command like this:

```
can you write a gridpane wp-cli command like this, but adding in the list of plugins I need to paste? The site.url is sconaz.org
gp wp {{site.url}} plugin activate {{space-separated-list-here}}
```

### 4. Change your hosts file to check the site and finish setup.

- Go to Settings > Beaver Builder and set up the white labeling. `/wp-content/mu-plugins/admin/assets/DigitalChurchFavicon.svg`
- Setup SMTP via Postmark
- Run tests on new installation

### 5. Change the DNS and Issue an SSL Certificate

## Post-Migration Testing

### 1. Beaver Builder

Make sure the branding settings are set as outlined here: [Beaver Builder Branding](/wordpress/plugins/beaver-builder/branding)   
`/wp-content/mu-plugins/admin/assets/DigitalChurchFavicon.svg`

### 2. Fluent SMTP

Make sure the client domain is added as a sending address in Postmark and working in FluentSMTP.

### 3. Update Airtable to Put Workspace on the Correct Server

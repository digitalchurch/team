# Troubleshooting GridPane Connection Issues

### 1. Contact Host Support

When the server disconnects from GridPane, it's always an issue at the IAAS provider (typically we use Vultr for this). As a result, the only way to address the issue is to contact support from the provider. See this message below:

:::note
Unfortunately, the server disconnecting from gridpane indicates an underlying issue at the server provider. It could be network issue or a hardware.

When the server is disconnected it means gridpane doesn't have access. It explains why subsequent commands fail. Here is our article for reference.

I would suggest opening a ticket with the server provider. They might have more info on why this is happening very often. Let us know how it goes. Thanks!

# Setting up a WPMT Github Repo using GridPane

The github repo should be downloaded from GridPane's full git repo template. The .gitignore file needs to be edited right away to make sure that the repo doesn't end up with files that it doesn't need.

### .gitignore

```
# Ignore the docker-compose.yml file
docker-compose.yml

# Ignore the wp-congig.php files
wp-config.php
wp-config-sample.php

# Ignore MacOS .DS_Store in all directories
**/.DS_Store
.DS_Store
wp-content/.DS_Store

# Ingore the entire uploads directory
wp-content/uploads/
```

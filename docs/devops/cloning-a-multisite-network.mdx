# Cloning a Multsite Network to a new Server via GridPane

Occasionally, we need to rebuild a new server for large multisite installations. This typically happens when we need to upgrade the OS of the server. When cloning a multisite network to a new server, here's the procedure we follow:

When cloning a network:


1.  Do a `wp db repair` on the source network first
1.  When complete, turn off page caching and enable wp-ultimo integration
1.  Setup Custom Multisite Cron
1.  Check sites using hosts file.
	-  Main Network Site
	-  Three Subdomains
	-  Three Mapped Digital Church Domains
	-  Three Mapped Client Domains (Top Traffic)

:::note title="Examples"
- digitalchurch.app
- [digitalchurch.com](http://digitalchurch.com)
- digitalchurch.agency
- yourdigital.church
- amez.digitalchurch.app
- city.digitalchurch.app
- dev.digitalchurch.app
- [cincinattichurch.org](http://cincinattichurch.org)
- [sconaz.org](http://sconaz.org)
- [fcchurch.org](http://fcchurch.org)

5.  Disable maintenance mode on target server
1.  Run Software Updates
1.  Re-enable caching.
1.  Check hosts file sites again
	1.  Clear BB Cache and Page Cache if Needed
1.  Update CDN Domain (digitalchurch.cloud) DNS
1.  Set DNS for sites via network domain (digitalchurch.app)
1.  Check client DNS and sites for changes. Probably on a different machine if possible.

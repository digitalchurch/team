# Updating WordPress Core, Themes, and Plugins

When updating software on our platform, we follow a strict procedure and document what updates are being made. This is the procedure.

## Document the Process

Create a Blog Post on our team site at https://digitalchurch.team to document the update process as you go. It will be an .mdx file with the following naming convention: `YYYY-MM-DD-updates.mdx`

```mdx

## Generate a Report of Available Updates

Enter the CLI via terminal on the server you wish to update and navigate to the site directory. Generate a report using the CLI command below, and paste it into the team blog post documentation.

### Theme Updates

```bash title="via wp-cli"
wp theme update --all --dry-run
```

```bash title="via GridPane"
gp wp digitalchurch.app theme update --all --dry-run
```

```bash title="via Docker"
docker-compose exec wordpress wp theme update --all --allow-root --dry-run
```

### Plugin Updates

```bash title="via wp-cli"
wp plugin update --all --dry-run
```

```bash title="via GridPane"
gp wp digitalchurch.app plugin update --all --dry-run
```

```bash title="via Docker"
docker-compose exec wordpress wp plugin update --all --allow-root --dry-run
```

### Core Update

```bash title="check version"
gp wp digitalchurch.app core version --extra
```

```bash title="check for updates"
gp wp digitalchurch.app core check-update
```

```bash title="Update Core via GridPane"
gp wp digitalchurch.app core update
```

```bash title="Update Core via Docker"
docker-compose exec wordpress wp core update --allow-root
```

## Clear the Caches

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app beaver clearcache
```

```bash
gp fix cached
```

## Testing

If you completed a core update, you'll need to run through a database upgrade for the network here: https://digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/network/upgrade.php

Once you've run all the updates and cleared all the caches, it's time to do some tests to make sure nothing broke in the process. Refer to the document: [Post Update Testing](/deevops/post-update-testing)

# Updating WordPress Core, Themes, and Plugins

When updating software on our platform, we follow a strict procedure and document what updates are being made. This is the procedure.

## Document the Process

Create a Blog Post on our team site at https://digitalchurch.team to document the update process as you go.

## Generate a Report of Available Updates

Enter the CLI via terminal on the server you wish to update and navigate to the site directory. Generate a report using the CLI command below, and paste it into the team blog post documentation.

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app plugin update --all --dry-run
```

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app theme update --all --dry-run
```

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app core version --extra
```

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app core check-update
```

Paste each report into the team blog post, but change the formatting slightly. Remove the top and bottom lines of `+----------------+` and replace the line just under the heading with the MDX table syntax like this:

```bash
| :- | :- | :- | :- |
```

That should make the tables look great on our team blog.


## Run Updates

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app plugin update --all
```

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app theme update --all
```

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app core update
```

## Clear the Caches

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app beaver clearcache
```

```bash
gp wp digitalchurch.app beaver clearcache
```

## Testing

If you completed a core update, you'll need to run through a database upgrade for the network here: https://digitalchurch.app/wp-admin/network/upgrade.php

Once you've run all the updates and cleared all the caches, it's time to do some tests to make sure nothing broke in the process. Refer to the document: [Post Update Testing](/)

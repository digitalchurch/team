[Additional Measures](./img/gridpane-security-additional-measures.jpg)

- Disable XMLRPC [true]

XMLRPC is a old form of communicating with WordPress that has been replaced by the REST API. It is no longer in use, but proses a security risk. Setting this to true blocks XMLRPC from all sites on the network, which also reduces server load from bots looking to exploit it.

- Block wp-content php [true]

This prevents PHP from being run inside the wp-content folder.

# Introduction

## Getting Started

Welcome to the Digital Church team! We are a group of people who share a passion for enabling churches to thrive in online ministry by providing tools and services that enhance the digital side of their ministries.

## Project Management

We use specific tools for each part of our operation. Here's the full rundown...

### Asana

We do our project management in [Asana](https://asana.com/). That may have been the very first thing you had to sign into when you started working with us. Client projects are divided into teams.

- Custom Client Projects
- Content Migrations
- Ongoing Retainers
- Support

### Everhour

We use Everhour to track time inside of Asana. We are able to set budgets for client projects and track the time directly on tasks in Asana.

## Brand Identity & Design

Figma serves as the home base for our Brand Identity & Design projects, however, in some cases we use Affinity Designer or Adobe tools to create the assets.

## Websites

### WordPress

Our website platform is built on [Self-Hosted WordPress Multisite](https://wordpress.org). Here's a list of the themes & plugins we use:

#### Custom Development

Our custom development is done mainly in vscode synced to github repos. Our main repo is a private repo called [Digital Church Admin](https://github.com/digitalchurch/admin).

#### Themes

- [Kadence Theme](https://www.kadencewp.com): For handling global options like colors, typography, and site branding.
- [Astra Theme](https://wpastra.com): Some of our older sites use the Astra Theme. We are actively migrating those to Kadence as we are able, however, we will likely develop our own design system plugin inside our admin plugin to handle global color palettes and other design standards.

#### Plugins

- [WP Ultimo](https://wpultimo.com): For website provisioning, domain mapping, and subscription management.
- [Kadence Theme](https://www.kadencewp.com): For handling global options like colors, typography, and site branding.
- [Beaver Builder](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com): For page layouts.
- [Beaver Themer](https://www.wpbeaverbuilder.com/beaver-themer/): For designing theme layouts for our various post types.
- [Meta Box](https://metabox.io): For all custom fields, post types, and taxonomies.

## Native Applications

### AppPresser

We use [AppPresser](https://apppresser.com) for native applications. The apps pull data from WordPress installations so there is no matinenance once the app is set up. We are working on our own custom built app as well to replace this so we don't have to do any setup or publishing of custom apps.

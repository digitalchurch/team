# Church Tech Health Assessment

A 5-minute diagnostic for churches ready to evaluate whether their technology is serving their mission—or slowly draining it.

**Scoring:**

- **3 points**: Strong / Always true
- **2 points**: Adequate / Usually true
- **1 point**: Weak / Sometimes true
- **0 points**: Absent / Never true

## Interpreting Your Score

### 60-75: Healthy Stack
Your church technology is well-integrated and serving your mission effectively. Focus on continuous improvement and staying current with capabilities.

### 45-59: Moderate Concerns
You're managing, but there are clear friction points. Consider consolidation opportunities in your lowest-scoring sections—they're likely costing you more than you realize.

### 30-44: Significant Challenges
Your tech stack is creating real drag on ministry effectiveness. Prioritize a consolidation strategy before adding any new tools.

### Below 30: Critical Fragmentation
Your scattered systems are actively working against your mission. Every week of delay costs time, money, and volunteer energy. Consolidation isn't optional—it's urgent stewardship.

## Your Lowest-Scoring Section

Look at your section totals. Your lowest score reveals your highest-priority improvement area:

- **Tool Consolidation** → You need fewer platforms, not more features
- **Data Integrity** → Your systems need to share a single source of truth
- **Budget Visibility** → Start with an audit; you can't optimize what you don't measure
- **Operational Efficiency** → Manual workarounds are burning your team's time
- **Team Experience** → Your tools are frustrating the people they're supposed to serve

---

## Next Steps

1. **Share this assessment** with 2-3 key staff members and compare notes
2. **Identify your biggest pain point** from your lowest-scoring section
3. **Book a demo** to see how an integrated platform can address it: [digitalchurch.com/demo](https://digitalchurch.com/demo/)
